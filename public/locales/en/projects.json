      "useScrollTracking": "Here we use the 'useScrollPosition' hook to track the window's scroll position via 'currPos'. Depending on the component's 'orientation' property, we set the 'axis' and 'axisEnd' values accordingly to handle both vertical and horizontal scrolling.\n\nThen we iterate through the sections and run 'doesOverlap' to check if the section overlaps with the window. If it does, it checks against the current 'topMost', and if it's higher, it becomes the 'topMost'.\n\nFinally, we call 'setScrolledTo' with the section's ID and element ref."
